# This architecture / CPU variant must NOT be used for any 64 bit
# platform builds. It is the lowest common denominator required
# to build an unbundled application or cts for all supported 32 and 64 bit
# platforms.
#
# If you're building a 64 bit platform (and not an application) the
# ARM-v8 specification allows you to assume all the features available in an
# armv7-a-neon CPU. You should set the following as 2nd arch/cpu variant:
