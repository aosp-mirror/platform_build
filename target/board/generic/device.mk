# NFC:
#   Provide default libnfc-nci.conf file for devices that does not have one in
#   vendor/etc because aosp system image (of aosp_$arch products) is going to
#   be used as GSI.
#   May need to remove the following for newly launched devices in P since this
#   NFC configuration file should be in vendor/etc, instead of system/etc
