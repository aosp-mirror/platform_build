# Configuration for Linux on ARM.
# Included by combo/select.mk

# You can set TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT to use an arch version other
# than ARMv5TE. Each value should correspond to a file named
# $(BUILD_COMBOS)/arch/<name>.mk which must contain
# makefile variable definitions. Their
# purpose is to allow module Android.mk files to selectively compile
# different versions of code based upon the funtionality and
# instructions available in a given architecture version.
#
# The blocks also define specific arch_variant_cflags, which
# include defines, and compiler settings for the given architecture
# version.
